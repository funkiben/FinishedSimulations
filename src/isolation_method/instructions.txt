<P>An important reaction that occurs in the atmosphere is</P>

<P align="center">
2 NO <I>(g)</I>  + O<SUB>2</SUB> <I>(g)</I>  &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp;  2 NO<SUB>2</SUB> <I>(g)</I>
</P>

<P>Nitrogen oxides (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) are produced by automobile engines, and the fate of these oxides in the environment is of considerable 
concern.  Modeling reactions involving nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>) are important in understanding the 
behavior of air pollution and in developing effective regulations.  Nitric oxide is a very reactive, colorless gas;  nitrogen dioxide 
is an orange-brown gas that is responsible for the characteristic color of Los Angeles smog.</P>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<P>In this experiment, the stopped-flow apparatus has been adapted to handle gases.  Both syringes are charged with gas mixtures at 1 atm 
pressure.  The syringe on the right contains 99% N<SUB>2</SUB> and 1% NO, which at 25<SUP>o</SUP> C corresponds with 
4.09 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP> mole/L NO.  The syringe on the left contains pure oxygen, which corresponds to 0.0409 mole/L O<SUB>2</SUB>.  
Both syringes are loaded with 10 mL of gas and at least 1 mL must be discharged during an experiment.</P>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<P>The reactants in the reaction are colorless;  the NO<SUB>2</SUB> product has an orange-brown color, and it is thus the NO<SUB>2</SUB> 
concentration that is measured experimentally. Stoichiometry can then be used to determine the concentration of NO. The graph at the right 
shows how the concentration of NO varies with time (the characteristic zero-order kinetic plot).  By clicking the appropriate button, 
characteristic first-order and second-order kinetic plots can also be prepared. </P>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<P>Perform this reaction several times, taking care to make sure that oxygen is always present in large excess.  Use the characteristic 
kinetic plot to determine the order of the reaction with respect to NO and the pseudo-rate constant for the chosen oxygen concentration.  
(Remember to take into account the reaction stoichiometry when calculating the rate constant.)</P>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<P>The points in the table 
are used to construct a ln <I>k<SUB>obs</SUB></I> vs ln [O<SUB>2</SUB>] plot in the graph at the lower right.  Use the slope and intercept of this 
plot to determine the order of the reaction with respect to oxygen and the reaction rate constant.</P>
